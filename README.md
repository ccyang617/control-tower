Server
------------- 


Basic REST API server for accessing weatherbox data. Eventually to be used
for inputting data as well (with proper tokens).


Todo:

* [ ] Clean up nasty code
* [ ] Basic documentation (routes, etc.)
* [ ] Scripted setup on a production machine
* [ ] Dockerize for easy testing
* [ ] Script to generate some trash data in a test machine
