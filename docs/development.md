# Development

It's highly suggested that you use vagrant and virtualbox to
do your development. This will allow you to make sure that the
application is installed correctly from scratch.

# Dependencies

You'll have to install the following things:

* Ruby
* Vagrant
* Virtualbox

# Environment

The machine setup is mostly scripted - run the following command
in the directory.

`vagrant up`

This may take a while (10-20 min depending on your network connection.
